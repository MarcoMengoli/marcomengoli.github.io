Software Engineering student at University of Bologna.
Since I was a child I love to solve problems. I really like to experiment new things, find creative solutions and implement do-it-yourself projects.

My main focus is in software development, in particular my favourite thematic is Software Engineering. My main ambition is to always improve the quality of the products I develop and also the way I do it.

I don't have a favorite language, because I strongly believe that each language has its own shot target. I mostly develop my software systems in C, C++, Java and Python. I have also used C#, Javascript, Visual Basic 6.0, Go and ASP for some academical projects and PHP, HTML & CSS when I produced web sites of some private companies or associations.

In the last years I'm an enthusiast maker: I really love to make lots of projects with my 4 Raspberry Pi boards using Linux Debian's based Raspbian distribution. I also use an Arduino Uno, a Sparkfun ESP8266 and a UDOO quad board. I found on electronics a new really enjoyable hobby.

I'm very happy to collaborate with the DICAM department (Department of Civil, Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering) building software to create a network of remote GPS sensors -made by a Raspberry Pi, a 3G dongle and a differential GPS antenna- to monitor critical areas from remote. I also work on software to simulate GPS constellations to calculate the quality of satellite visibility in urban environments.

I also work since I was 16 on the realization of audio and video services for concerts and public festivals, included making video footages on national live television for basketball matches.

One thing that gives me some satisfactions is to teach and give reps of informatics and maths to younger students. I also have partecipated on some public initiatives for approaching teenagers to computing.
